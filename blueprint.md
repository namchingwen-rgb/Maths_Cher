# Blueprint for Maths Cher

## Purpose and Capabilities

"Maths Cher" is a fun and interactive math game designed to make learning math an exciting adventure. The game transforms routine math problems into a quest where users can level up, earn points, and track their progress. This application is designed to be engaging for users of all ages.

### Core Features:

*   **Gamified Learning:** Instead of a standard test format, users embark on a quest, solving math problems to progress.
*   **Interactive UI:** A modern and visually appealing interface with animations and effects to enhance the user experience.
*   **Levels and Progression:** Users start at level 1 and can progress to higher levels with increasing difficulty.
*   **Scoring and Feedback:** Instant feedback on answers and a scoring system to track performance.
*   **Responsive Design:** The application will be fully responsive and accessible on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

## Project Outline (New Vision)

The project will be a framework-less web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, leveraging modern web standards to create a rich user experience.

### Style, Design, and Features:

*   **Structure (`index.html`):** The HTML will be restructured to create a more immersive game-like environment. This will include:
    *   A clear header with the game title "Maths Cher".
    *   A main game area where the math problems are presented.
    *   A status bar to display the current level, score, and remaining lives.
    *   A footer with links to social media and other relevant information.
*   **Styling (`style.css`):** The CSS will be completely overhauled to create a modern and engaging design.
    *   **Color Palette:** A vibrant and energetic color palette will be used.
    *   **Typography:** Expressive and readable fonts will be used for different text elements.
    *   **Layout:** A responsive and flexible layout using modern CSS techniques like Flexbox or Grid.
    *   **Animations:** Subtle animations and transitions will be added to provide a more dynamic experience.
*   **Scripting (`main.js`):** The JavaScript will be rewritten to implement the new game logic.
    *   **Game State Management:** A clear and robust system to manage the game state, including the current level, score, and user progress.
    *   **Problem Generation:** A function to generate math problems based on the current level of difficulty.
    *   **User Interaction:** Event listeners to handle user input and interactions with the game elements.
    *   **Web Components:** The use of Web Components to create reusable UI elements.
